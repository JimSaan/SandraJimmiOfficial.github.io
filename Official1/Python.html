										<h3>Enhancing Credit Risk Analysis with Machine Learning: A Comparative Study</h3>
										<p>This project utilized machine learning to develop a predictive model for credit risk analysis. Personal and professional data were used to assess the creditworthiness of borrowers. Various models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting, Light GBM, XGBoost, and SVMs, were evaluated using metrics like precision-recall curves, ROC AUC curves, and accuracy. Decision Trees emerged as the most effective model due to its superior performance in identifying defaulters. Model selection should align with the bank's priority—either identification accuracy or defaulter detection. The project identified areas for further refinement such as data selection, parameter tuning, and potential adoption of neural networks.</p>

										<h3>Sentiment Analysis & Seasonal Trends for a Women's E-commerce Store</h3>
										<p>This project employs sentiment analysis and NLP to assess customer reviews for a women's E-commerce store. Positive reviews highlighted satisfaction with soft, comfortable fabrics, especially for dresses, jeans, and pants, while negative sentiment focused on sizing issues and ordinary styles. Seasonal analysis showed a preference for white, black, and blue products, and emphasized the importance of size, color, and material. Limitations included lack of review dates for seasonal timelines and missing product IDs.</p>

										<h3>Sector Analysis for Company Dissolution and Investment Opportunities - Companies House API</h3>
										<p>This project comprises two parts. The first part involves analyzing trends of company dissolutions in the sectors of Agriculture, Poultry Farming, and Processed Food using the Company House API. The data from 2010 to 2022 suggested a decreasing dissolution rate in the Agriculture sector, but an increasing trend in the Processed Food sector, highlighting a potential need for government support in the latter sector. The Poultry Farming sector lacked sufficient data for analysis.
										<br><br>
											The second part of the project focused on identifying promising sectors for an investment firm to expand its portfolio. Companies registered during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Renting and Leasing, Retail, and Wholesale sectors were analyzed. Despite the challenges posed by the pandemic, the Retail sector showed robustness with fewer legal charges and a significant increase in newly registered companies, suggesting a promising return potential.</p>

										<h3>Nell’s Lettings - Real Estate Valuation Analysis</h3>
										<p>This data-driven project provides insightful analytics for Nell's Lettings on housing preferences and value determinants in California. Key findings include an average preference for 5-room houses aged between 14 and 36 years among homeowners earning $100,000 to $300,000. By employing a Linear Regression Model, the project reveals the impactful correlations between house features and their prices, most notably, the positive relationship of medium income and number of bedrooms to house prices.</p>

										<h3>Crime Trends & Hotspots Analysis - Chicago</h3>
										<p>This analytical project was developed for the Ministry of Defence to evaluate crime trends in Chicago from 2012 to 2017. The analysis revealed a gradual decline in the number of crimes over these years but a more significant reduction in arrests, highlighting a discrepancy that signals the need for an augmented police force. A heatmap showed a seasonal trend with a higher prevalence of crime in May to October, suggesting a need for heightened police vigilance during these months. The areas most prone to crime include streets, residential areas, apartments, and sidewalks. A limitation of this project is the lack of data on why the number of arrests decreased over the study period.

										<h3> Solving the Single Allocation p-Hub Location Problem Using Simulated Annealing</h3>
										<p>This project applies the Simulated Annealing meta-heuristic method to solve the Single Allocation p-Hub Location Problem (SApHLP), a classic optimization issue in operations research. This problem involves strategically locating hub facilities to minimize cost and optimize allocation of demand. The study addresses economies of scale in inter-hub connections and works with a pre-defined number of hub facilities. Tests were run on CAB, TR, and RGP datasets using varying initial solutions, ensuring thorough examination. The project showcases the strength of Simulated Annealing in generating optimal or near-optimal solutions for complex optimization problems.</p>

										<h3>Applying Tabu Search to the Single Allocation p-Hub Location Problem</h3>
										<p>This project leverages Tabu Search, a memory-based meta-heuristic, to address the Single Allocation p-Hub Location Problem (SApHLP)—an optimization challenge in operations research. This issue involves determining optimal hub locations to minimize costs and maximize demand allocation, given a pre-set number of hubs. The project tests the effectiveness of Tabu Search on several benchmark problems from CAB, TR, and RGP datasets, running the algorithm multiple times with varying initial solutions. The results showcase Tabu Search's potential in optimizing logistics and transportation planning.</p>
